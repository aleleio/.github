# Welcome to alele.io! :monkey_face:

[alele.io](https://alele.io) is a public database of teambuilding games. The database is wrapped in a REST API which is available at [alele.io/api](https://alele.io/api) and can be accessed through the web and mobile devices. It's a labour of love and relies on its community to survive and thrive.

### How can you help?

alele.io will only thrive if an active community supports it. If you are considering to help, it would be really nice [to hear from you](https://alele.io/contact). We are a group of people who like to code and think about teambuilding together. If you don't have the time but would still like to support the project, you can also [give money to support alele.io](https://donorbox.org/alele-io-donation).

Thank you for considering to help in the first place! You're awesome! :star2:
