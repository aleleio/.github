# Welcome to alele.io! :monkey_face:

[alele.io](https://alele.io) is a public database of teambuilding games. The database is wrapped in a REST API which is available at [alele.io/api](https://alele.io/api) and can be accessed through the web and mobile devices. It's a labour of love and relies on its community to survive and thrive.

So, how can you help?

### Create a community

alele.io will only thrive if an active community supports it. It's not easy to build and moderate one.
If you have an idea how to get this process going or improve it, it would be great if you could
[get in touch](https://alele.io/contact)!

### Improve the database

The database of games is the foundation of alele.io. Do you have teambuilding games that are still missing?
Would you like to make the description of existing games better? [We'll set you up with an account!](https://alele.io/contact)

### Improve the code

Are you familiar with any one of these?

* Python
* JavaScript in the frontend
* Flutter/Dart or iOS / Android development
* Ops/DevOps, especially integration/deployment

Please [get in touch](https://alele.io/contact) or check out our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and
clone the repo right away! There's so much to do: The roadmap for both API and WEB components have a long list
of features still missing (e.g. versioning for games, user-curated collections of games..) and the codebase needs
a good review! If you are just getting started with one of the above or are simply curious, that's great as well!
Curious people are the best!

### Help with design

Are you great with visuals? I'd love to [hear your thoughts](https://alele.io/contact) on how alele.io can
be even prettier/more usable. But you don't have to be a UX/UI designer - if you can **draw** get in touch!

### Thinking about Teambuilding together

If you have experience in working with groups professionally or from volunteering in NGOs it'd be great
[to hear from you](https://alele.io/contact)! There are very few good online resources about group development, 
and it would be great if alele.io could provide not just games but also helpful information on how and when to use them.
This includes thinking of better ways to search the database and how to display the games.

### Donate money
If you don't have time or none of the above work for you but you would still like to help, you can give money
to support alele.io. This will help pay the server bills and it's also a great motivation to see that people
like your work so much, they are willing to give money. Motivation is key to keep alele.io going.
Finally, there are plans to pay developers to help with realising more complex features (e.g. iOS/Android apps).
Your donation ensures that development is going to happen a lot faster:
