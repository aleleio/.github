# Welcome to alele.io! :monkey_face:

[alele.io](https://alele.io) is a public database of teambuilding games. The database is wrapped in a REST API which is available at [alele.io/api](https://alele.io/api) and can be accessed through the web and mobile devices. It's a labour of love and relies on its community to survive and thrive.

### How can you help?

alele.io will only thrive if an active community supports it. We currently welcome people with skills in...

- growing and organizing a community
- making the [games collection](https://github.com/aleleio/teambuilding-games) better
- Python
- Frontend JS
- Flutter/Dart or iOS/Android development
- UX and UI design, as well as visuals
- thinking about teambuilding together

If you have experience in working with groups professionally or from volunteering in NGOs it'd be great [to hear from you](https://alele.io/contact)! There are very few good online resources about group development, and it would be great if alele.io could provide not just games but also helpful information on how and when to use them. This includes thinking of better ways to search the database and how to display the games.

### Donate money

If you don't have time or none of the above work for you but you would still like to help, you can give money to support alele.io. This will help pay the server bills and it's also a great motivation to see that people like your work so much, they are willing to give money. Motivation is key to keeping alele.io going. Finally, there are plans to pay developers to help with realising more complex features (e.g. iOS/Android apps). Your donation ensures that development is going to happen a lot faster:
